Playground for myself to get into Blazor programming! This might become a usefull repo later on.

Im deploying the app with VS 2022 directly to my IIS Webserver 


The application as it is provides safe and efficient directory browsing and file fetching from an external source.
It also comes with built-in user management features, role management and enables setting custom access rules for individual files. 

For future development I'd like to add:

- Multimedia features e.g. embedded Image and video viewing, maybe thumbnails ✓

- Multiple remote sources ✓

- Option to upload files 

- Making file fetching even more secure with an generated "access token" or some sort like that 

- Maybe later adding Nextcloud-like features  



To Initialize the Database:
